					Leveraging Meteor and famous-views for a prototype was a spectacular experience! Being able to use templates, routing along with server and client data bindings really opened my eyes to the possibilities. You could do those things with other frameworks but not at the incredible speed Meteor provides. The performant animations that Famo.us provided allowed me to bring polish to a short project that would have otherwise been impossible given the time and budgetary constraints. Thank you!
